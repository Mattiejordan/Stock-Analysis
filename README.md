# Stock-Analysis

## Everyone is *Going Green* Including Steve's Parents' Stock Options!
#### Is DAQO everything their heart could desire? How does the competitve green energy market compare?
###### How did the coding for this process go and how to improve it??


By assisting financial advisor, Steve, we can help make the best suggestions for his parents financial future and still stay true to their promotion of renewable green energy. By making a few analyses of a dozen green energy stocks in 2017 and 2018 we can make strong comparisons. The coding for this process has been refactored for efficiency. By streamlining the coding process script times are reduced. This VBA format of coding is the chosen method due to the versatilty of a reusable code that can be reused for a change of stocks. 

### An overview of Green Stocks Analyses in 2018
##### Will DAQO's performance make Steve's Parents flip over like a *DQ BLIZZARD*?
